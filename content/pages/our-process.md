              Our process starts by evaluating our partnerâ€™s needs and advising
              on fund structure. Our product team, composed of industry veterans
              with extensive expertise in investment product construction and
              management, then identifies the optimal structure and investment
              objectives. Once these are established, we collaborate with legal
              counsel to develop all the required offering materials.
